## How to custumize template

Now you are ready to start working. You can custumize our template as you want to.

### Add new page content section

Pages are build by content sections. We've prepared 7 content sections for you (Hero section, Logos section, Content section, Features section, CTA section, Testimonial section and Contact section). 

Let's say you want to add new section with text and image next to each other.

#### 1. Change model

Go to `api/model/ContentBlocks.ts` and add `'imageWithTextSection'` to `ContentBlockType` enum. We'll use `image` and `content` fields from `ContentBlock` to store our data.
```ts title="api/model/ContentBlocks.ts"
export const ContentBlockType = def.createEnum(
	'heroSection',
	'logosSection',
	'contentSection',
	'featureSection',
	'ctaSection',
	'testimonialSection',
	'contactSection',
	/* highlight-start */
	'imageWithTextSection',
	/* highlight-end */
)
```

#### 2. Execute [migrations](/schema/migrations)  

Run migration command to aplicate your changes.

```bash
npm run contember migrations:diff headless-cms add-image-with-text-section
```

Select *"Yes and execute immediately"* and wait for the migration to finish.

1. Go to `admin/components/ContentBlocks.tsx`

```tsx title="admin/components/ContentBlocks.tsx"
export const ContentBlocks = Component(
	() => (
		<BlockRepeater
			field="blocks"
			label={undefined}
			discriminationField="type"
			sortableBy="order"
			addButtonText="Add content block"
		>
		...
		/* highlight-start */
			<Block discriminateBy="imageWithTextSection" label="Image with text section" >
				<ContentField />
				<ImageUploadField
					label={locale["Image"]}
					urlField="image.url"
					widthField="image.width"
					heightField="image.height"
				>
					<TextField field="image.alt" label={locale["Alternative text"]} />
				</ImageUploadField>
			</Block>
		/* highlight-end */
	),
	'ContentBlocks',
)
```
